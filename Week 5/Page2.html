    <h2><em>What is Web Design?</em></h2>
    <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It<br/>
        usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than<br/>
        software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for<br/>
        desktop browsers, however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet<br/>
        browsers has become ever-increasinly important.
